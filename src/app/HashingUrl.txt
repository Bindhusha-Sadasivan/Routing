Hashing URL:

We have lot of routes like /servers, /users,..

These routes works fine on our local machine.

But this is not something which you should take for granted.

Because these URL's are always parsed by the server which is going to host your application first and not by angular.

If we have a 404 error, our application should return a 404 error page.

localhost:4000/servers means it will look for the same /servers in your server on the real server hosting your web application.

In SPA, we dont have the routes here, but we have only index.html which is our app.

But the server will not parse any routes in the index.htm and it will throw 404 error.

We have to use {useHash:true}. so that it will add a # between the domain and the routes.

localhost:4000/#/servers

Server will parse before # and the angular will look up after #. SO we will not get any 404 error on production
