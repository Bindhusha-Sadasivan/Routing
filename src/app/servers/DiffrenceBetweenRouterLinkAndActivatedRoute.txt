RouterLink will remember in which page we are currently in and where we have to move when we click on the link.

Example:

  <a routerLink="/servers">Reload Component</a>

Currently, I am on the Servers component, when i click on this a tag, angular remembers, i am on http://localhost:4200/servers.
And then it navigates again to this page only http://localhost:4200/servers

  <a routerLink="servers">Reload Component</a>

This routerLink will search for http://localhost:4200/servers/servers , as we didnt write any route or path, it will throw error.

ActivatedRouter will not remember in which page I am on currently. That is why we are using this

{relativeTo:this.route}

this.route comes from the ACtivatedRoute and it tells that we are currently on this page http://localhost:4200/servers.

 <button (click)="onReloadPage()" class="btn btn-primary mt-2 mb-2">Reload Page</button>
 this.router.navigate(['/servers'], {relativeTo:this.route});

When i click on the button it has to go to http://localhost:4200/servers from http://localhost:4200/servers.
