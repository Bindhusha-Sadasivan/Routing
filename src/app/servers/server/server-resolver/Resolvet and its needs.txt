Resolver:

How we display the data dynamically before we render a route.

In Server components, the three servers are already load, when i click on the individual server, i want to load it from the backend, this will take some couple of mutes.


In such case we need a resolver.

This is also a service like CanActivate or CanDeactivate which will allow us to run some code before the route is rendered.

Resolver cannot decide whether we have to render this route or not or the component should be displayed or not.

Resolver will always render the component in the end.

But it does some pre loading.

It will fetch some data, the component needs later on.
